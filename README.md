Ever found a cool enchanted book that you wanted to get more of? This mod is for you! Gather Enchantment Fragments from existing enchantments and craft enchanted books using the Enchantment Crafting Table.

### Features 
* Enchantment Fragments
* Enchantment Crafting Table
<br/>

### How to get Enchantment Fragments? 
Simply drop an enchanted book next to an exploding creeper. The enchanted book will fracture and transform into an Enchantment Fragment! The Fragment will retain all the enchantments of the original book. Be careful though, as it has limited uses! They can vary from 4 to 8 and once the number drops to 0, the Enchantment Fragment will get destroyed.

### How to get an Enchantment Crafting Table? 
Simply craft it! It is crafted using 4 copper ingots, 3 amethyst shards, a lectern, and an enchanting table. The recipe is quite expensive, but it's worth it!

### How to craft an enchantment? 
Put in the designated slots a book, a piece of lapis lazuli, and an Enchantment Fragment. You will get an enchanted book that has exactly the same enchantments as the fragment. Once you take the enchanted book from the table, the Enchantment Fragment will have its available uses decreased by 1. Keep in mind you can't get Enchantment Fragments from Reconstructed books!
